Who is the first king of Rome?

[Bot]:
Let's talk about ancient Rome!

The first king of Rome is a very important person in history. His name was Romulus.

Romulus lived over 2,700 years ago, and he's said to have founded the city of Rome around 753 BC. Legend has it that he and his twin brother Remus argued over who would rule Rome, and unfortunately, Romulus ended up killing Remus.

After that, Romulus became the first king of Rome. He ruled for many years and did some important things like building walls to protect the city and creating laws to help keep everyone safe.

But don't worry if you didn't know all this already! We're just starting our journey through history together, and we'll explore more about ancient Rome soon!

[You]: 
who is the last one?

[Bot]:
Let's continue our journey through ancient Rome!

The last king of Rome is a bit of a sad story. His name was Tarquinius Superbus, and he lived over 2,500 years ago.

Tarquinius Superbus was the seventh and final king of Rome, and he ruled from around 534 to 509 BC. He became really powerful and thought only of himself, which made the other Romans unhappy. They were tired of being bossed around by one person and wanted more freedom.

Eventually, the people of Rome got together and decided they'd had enough! They chased Tarquinius Superbus out of Rome and ended up creating a new form of government – called a republic!

That's right; after 244 years of kings, the Romans chose to be governed by leaders who weren't from royal families. This was a big change for ancient Rome, and it would go on to shape the course of history.

So, that's the story of Tarquinius Superbus – the last king of Rome!
